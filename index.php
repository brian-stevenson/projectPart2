		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<img src="./img/me.jpg" alt="Picture of me" align=left style="width:160px;height:250px;">
		<p>
			I am currently a fourth year student in the Computer Engineering program in the Swanson School of Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh with plans to graduate in the spring of 2017. I graduated from Upper St. Clair High School in 2013, and have been actively progressing my programming skills in that time. I also have been recognised in other fields such as public speaking, entrepeneurship, music performance, and research.  </br></br>Some fun facts about myself: In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, or doing any number of things with my friends including: board gaming, video gaming, or simply hanging out. I play five different instruments: the piano, the guitar, the saxophone, the trumpet, and the accordion. I prefer cats to dogs, pie to cake, and PC to every other gaming console.
